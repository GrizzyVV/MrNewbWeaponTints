# MrNewbWeaponTints

Welcome to the readme :)

This is Weapon Tints for ox_inventory on qb-core

Nobody has released it free and I wanted to help people so I am releasing this, dont be a jerk and sell it please. I encourage prs, sharing code and working with people.
I do ask you dont rename it as its my first release in over a year, while small its got a good use.
Also thank you to the ox team for giving us this at all.
